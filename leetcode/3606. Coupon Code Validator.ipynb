    "You are given three arrays of length n that describe the properties of n coupons: code, businessLine, and isActive. The ith coupon has:\n",

    "    code[i]: a string representing the coupon identifier.\n",

    "    code[i] is non-empty and consists only of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores (_).\n",
