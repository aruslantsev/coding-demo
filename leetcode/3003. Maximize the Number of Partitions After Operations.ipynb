    "You are given a string s and an integer k.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you are allowed to change at most one index in s to another lowercase English letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, do the following partitioning operation until s is empty:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Choose the longest prefix of s containing at most k distinct characters.\n",
    "    Delete the prefix from s and increase the number of partitions by one. The remaining characters (if any) in s maintain their initial order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return an integer denoting the maximum number of resulting partitions after the operations by optimally choosing at most one index to change.\n",

    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"accca\", k = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal way is to change s[2] to something other than a and c, for example, b. then it becomes \"acbca\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we perform the operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters is \"ac\", we remove it and s becomes \"bca\".\n",
    "    Now The longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters is \"bc\", so we remove it and s becomes \"a\".\n",
    "    Finally, we remove \"a\" and s becomes empty, so the procedure ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing the operations, the string is divided into 3 partitions, so the answer is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"aabaab\", k = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially s contains 2 distinct characters, so whichever character we change, it will contain at most 3 distinct characters, so the longest prefix with at most 3 distinct characters would always be all of it, therefore the answer is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"xxyz\", k = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal way is to change s[0] or s[1] to something other than characters in s, for example, to change s[0] to w.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then s becomes \"wxyz\", which consists of 4 distinct characters, so as k is 1, it will divide into 4 partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 <= s.length <= 104\n",
    "    s consists only of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "    1 <= k <= 26\n",
