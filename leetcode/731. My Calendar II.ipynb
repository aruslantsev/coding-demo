    "You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.\n",

    "The event can be represented as a pair of integers startTime and endTime that represents a booking on the half-open interval [startTime, endTime), the range of real numbers x such that startTime <= x < endTime.\n",
