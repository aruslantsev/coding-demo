    "You are given an array of positive integers arr. Perform some operations (possibly none) on arr so that it satisfies these conditions:\n",

    "    The value of the first element in arr must be 1.\n",
    "    The absolute difference between any 2 adjacent elements must be less than or equal to 1. In other words, abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) <= 1 for each i where 1 <= i < arr.length (0-indexed). abs(x) is the absolute value of x.\n",
