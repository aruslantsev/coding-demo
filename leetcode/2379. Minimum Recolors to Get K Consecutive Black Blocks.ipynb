    "You are given a 0-indexed string blocks of length n, where blocks[i] is either 'W' or 'B', representing the color of the ith block. The characters 'W' and 'B' denote the colors white and black, respectively.\n",

    "One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks\n",
    "so that blocks = \"BBBBBBBWBW\". \n",
    "It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in less than 3 operations.\n",

    "No changes need to be made, since 2 consecutive black blocks already exist.\n",
