    "Design a data structure that can efficiently manage data packets in a network router. Each data packet consists of the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    source: A unique identifier for the machine that generated the packet.\n",
    "    destination: A unique identifier for the target machine.\n",
    "    timestamp: The time at which the packet arrived at the router.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the Router class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Router(int memoryLimit): Initializes the Router object with a fixed memory limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    memoryLimit is the maximum number of packets the router can store at any given time.\n",
    "    If adding a new packet would exceed this limit, the oldest packet must be removed to free up space.\n",
    "\n",
    "bool addPacket(int source, int destination, int timestamp): Adds a packet with the given attributes to the router.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A packet is considered a duplicate if another packet with the same source, destination, and timestamp already exists in the router.\n",
    "    Return true if the packet is successfully added (i.e., it is not a duplicate); otherwise return false.\n",
    "\n",
    "int[] forwardPacket(): Forwards the next packet in FIFO (First In First Out) order.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Remove the packet from storage.\n",
    "    Return the packet as an array [source, destination, timestamp].\n",
    "    If there are no packets to forward, return an empty array.\n",
    "\n",
    "int getCount(int destination, int startTime, int endTime):\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns the number of packets currently stored in the router (i.e., not yet forwarded) that have the specified destination and have timestamps in the inclusive range [startTime, endTime].\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that queries for addPacket will be made in increasing order of timestamp.\n",
