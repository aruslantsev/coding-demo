    "Design a food rating system that can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Modify the rating of a food item listed in the system.\n",
    "    Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the FoodRatings class:\n",
    "\n",
    "    FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings) Initializes the system. The food items are described by foods, cuisines and ratings, all of which have a length of n.\n",
    "        foods[i] is the name of the ith food,\n",
    "        cuisines[i] is the type of cuisine of the ith food, and\n",
    "        ratings[i] is the initial rating of the ith food.\n",
    "    void changeRating(String food, int newRating) Changes the rating of the food item with the name food.\n",
    "    String highestRated(String cuisine) Returns the name of the food item that has the highest rating for the given type of cuisine. If there is a tie, return the item with the lexicographically smaller name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a string x is lexicographically smaller than string y if x comes before y in dictionary order, that is, either x is a prefix of y, or if i is the first position such that x[i] != y[i], then x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order.\n",
