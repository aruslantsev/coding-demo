    "There is a restaurant with a single chef. You are given an array customers, where customers[i] = [arrivali, timei]:\n",

    "    arrivali is the arrival time of the ith customer. The arrival times are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n",

    "When a customer arrives, he gives the chef his order, and the chef starts preparing it once he is idle. The customer waits till the chef finishes preparing his order. The chef does not prepare food for more than one customer at a time. The chef prepares food for customers in the order they were given in the input.\n",

    "1) The first customer arrives at time 1, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 1, and finishes at time 3, so the waiting time of the first customer is 3 - 1 = 2.\n",

    "4) The fourth customer arrives at time 20, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 20, and finishes at time 21, so the waiting time of the fourth customer is 21 - 20 = 1.\n",
