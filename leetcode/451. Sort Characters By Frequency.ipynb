    "Input: s = \"tree\"\n",
    "Output: \"eert\"\n",
    "Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.\n",
    "So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore \"eetr\" is also a valid answer.\n",

    "Note that \"cacaca\" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.\n",
