    "You are given an integer numberOfUsers representing the total number of users and an array events of size n x 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each events[i] can be either of the following two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Message Event: [\"MESSAGE\", \"timestampi\", \"mentions_stringi\"]\n",
    "        This event indicates that a set of users was mentioned in a message at timestampi.\n",
    "        The mentions_stringi string can contain one of the following tokens:\n",
    "            id<number>: where <number> is an integer in range [0,numberOfUsers - 1]. There can be multiple ids separated by a single whitespace and may contain duplicates. This can mention even the offline users.\n",
    "            ALL: mentions all users.\n",
    "            HERE: mentions all online users.\n",
    "    Offline Event: [\"OFFLINE\", \"timestampi\", \"idi\"]\n",
    "        This event indicates that the user idi had become offline at timestampi for 60 time units. The user will automatically be online again at time timestampi + 60.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return an array mentions where mentions[i] represents the number of mentions the user with id i has across all MESSAGE events.\n",
    "\n",
    "All users are initially online, and if a user goes offline or comes back online, their status change is processed before handling any message event that occurs at the same timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a user can be mentioned multiple times in a single message event, and each mention should be counted separately.\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [[\"OFFLINE\",\"10\",\"0\"],[\"MESSAGE\",\"12\",\"HERE\"]]\n",
