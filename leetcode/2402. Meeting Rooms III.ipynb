    "You are given an integer n. There are n rooms numbered from 0 to n - 1.\n",

    "    Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the lowest number.\n",
    "    If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the same duration as the original meeting.\n",
