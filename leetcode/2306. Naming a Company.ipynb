    "You are given an array of strings ideas that represents a list of names to be used in the process of naming a company. The process of naming a company is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Choose 2 distinct names from ideas, call them ideaA and ideaB.\n",
    "    Swap the first letters of ideaA and ideaB with each other.\n",
    "    If both of the new names are not found in the original ideas, then the name ideaA ideaB (the concatenation of ideaA and ideaB, separated by a space) is a valid company name.\n",

    "- (\"coffee\", \"donuts\"): The company name created is \"doffee conuts\".\n",
    "- (\"donuts\", \"coffee\"): The company name created is \"conuts doffee\".\n",

    "The following are some examples of invalid selections:\n",
    "- (\"coffee\", \"time\"): The name \"toffee\" formed after swapping already exists in the original array.\n",
    "- (\"time\", \"toffee\"): Both names are still the same after swapping and exist in the original array.\n",
