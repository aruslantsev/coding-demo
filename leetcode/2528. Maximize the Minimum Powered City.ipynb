    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array stations of length n, where stations[i] represents the number of power stations in the ith city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In other words, if the range is denoted by r, then a power station at city i can provide power to all cities j such that |i - j| <= r and 0 <= i, j <= n - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that |x| denotes absolute value. For example, |7 - 5| = 2 and |3 - 10| = 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.\n",
    "\n",
    "The government has sanctioned building k more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.\n",

    "Given the two integers r and k, return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.\n",

    "Explanation: \n",
    "One of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1. \n",
    "So stations will become [1,4,4,5,0].\n",

    "- City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.\n",
