    "Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.\n",
    "    Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.\n",
    "    Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.\n",
    "    Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. \"123\" -> 123, \"0032\" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\n",
    "    If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.\n",
    "    Return the integer as the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.\n",
    "    Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",

    "Input: s = \"42\"\n",
    "Output: 42\n",

    "           ^\n",
