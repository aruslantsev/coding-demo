    "Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.\n",
    "        For example, abcde -> aecdb\n",
    "    Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.\n",
    "        For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)\n",
