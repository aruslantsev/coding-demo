    "You are given a 2D integer array items where items[i] = [pricei, beautyi] denotes the price and beauty of an item respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also given a 0-indexed integer array queries. For each queries[j], you want to determine the maximum beauty of an item whose price is less than or equal to queries[j]. If no such item exists, then the answer to this query is 0.\n",

    "Return an array answer of the same length as queries where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: items = [[1,2],[3,2],[2,4],[5,6],[3,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n",
    "Output: [2,4,5,5,6,6]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- For queries[0]=1, [1,2] is the only item which has price <= 1. Hence, the answer for this query is 2.\n",
    "- For queries[1]=2, the items which can be considered are [1,2] and [2,4]. \n",
    "  The maximum beauty among them is 4.\n",

    "  The maximum beauty among them is 5.\n",
    "- For queries[4]=5 and queries[5]=6, all items can be considered.\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: items = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]], queries = [1]\n",
    "Output: [4]\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "The price of every item is equal to 1, so we choose the item with the maximum beauty 4. \n",

    "Output: [0]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "No item has a price less than or equal to 5, so no item can be chosen.\n",
